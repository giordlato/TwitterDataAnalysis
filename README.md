Personal project to analyze Twitter's tweets sentiments.
Sadly, i do not have 100 euros to spend on the premium plan for Twitter API, so i have partially aborted the idea, i have decided to use an offline database of the best indicator of the sentiment of people: Donald Trump's twitter account (Lol)
You'll find here the databases used, the code, and also the code one could use for the twitter starting idea if he were to have the premium subscription.

Files description:

Datas = Just a first test, it's a prototype to do twitter scraping but you'd need a lot of cash, damn you musk.

Sentiment = Python code to study Trump's tweets' sentiment over the years.

WordsCount = Python code to study the annoying Orange's favourite words.

Topics = Python code to study major topics' frequency

TrumpTweetsIdentifier = Neural network (backend)

TrumpOrMusk = You can use it to tesk if a tweet belongs to the Orange man or the Crazy rocket guy
